		<div>Failures
</div>
		<div>Time
</div>
		<div>At Failure High everybody has a learning disability so failure is the norm and graduation is rare. As a person with a learning disability you will experience the frustration of constant failure as you struggle to pass each grade and finally graduate from Failure High.
At each grade level you will have to accomplish a task, handicapped with a new learning disability. Your failure to accomplish these tasks and graduate to the next level should give you some feeling for the frustrations, disappoint and even anger of the learning disabled as they struggle in a seemingly impossible  system.
You have 30 seconds to accomplish your task and move on to the next grade. It is easy,  just read the instructions. You can get a quick glance at the instructions without your learning ability but that cost you 10 failure points.  Each time you fail it is back to square one. You get a total of 40 failures before you flunk out school.
